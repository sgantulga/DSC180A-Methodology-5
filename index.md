**1. what is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
I found the spectrogram of the collected bird data interesting. Even though we only briefly looked at spectrogram, it's interesting how the sounds of birds, planes, insects, and other things can be layered in one spectrogram. So even if I cannot hear everything, I can see it on the spectrogram so it makes it possible for me to label the data through seeing the patterns.  

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
One potential investigation would be to see if the planes and other air traffic like helicopters and jets had any effect on frequency of bird songs. Since the collected bird data includes recordings during COVID, it should make for an interesting comparison between times when there was a lot of air traffic and times when there was very little air traffic.  

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
I think my group brainstormed with our mentor to pivot when our original project for this quarter did not work. While I like that our input was taken into account, I think if there was already a Plan B, we could have put some of our time to better use and immediately started working on Plan B.  

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
So far, we've mainly been working with JavaScript code but I'm interested in more data related techniques so I'm looking forward to neural networks and modeling next quarter.
